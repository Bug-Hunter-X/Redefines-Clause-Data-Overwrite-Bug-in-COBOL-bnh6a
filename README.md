This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs involving the REDEFINES clause. The REDEFINES clause allows multiple data items to share the same storage area. While efficient, it can lead to unexpected behavior if not managed carefully. This example shows how changes to one data item affect others that share the same storage. The solution demonstrates a more robust way to manage the REDEFINES clause, ensuring that data integrity is maintained.
